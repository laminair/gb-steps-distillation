"""Load a fast tokenizer the way every step in this collection must: never AutoTokenizer.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS AT ALL. A Granite directory's `tokenizer_config.json` declares
`tokenizer_class: "GPT2Tokenizer"`. `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` honours that, constructs
GPT2TokenizerFast, and that class imposes its OWN plain ByteLevel `pre_tokenizer` over the
one stored in `tokenizer.json`. It does not error. It silently mis-segments: 26.1 versus
3.29 PPL/token on the granite-4.1 base student, whose trained pre_tokenizer is
`Sequence[Split(regex), ByteLevel]` (measured -- jobs 1136957/1137115/1137253, and see
docs/tokenizer_mismatch.md). Deleting the key is not enough either: with a `config.json`
present, the `model_type: granite` fallback through TOKENIZER_MAPPING_NAMES revives the
override.

`PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_file=...)` loads the serialized tokenizer and nothing
else, so it is immune BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by remembering to pass the right
directory. `retag_student.py` and `prep_corpus.py` each arrived at this independently; the
third consumer (`distill-eval`'s divergence metrics) is where it became worth sharing, and
the SECOND time it was worth sharing -- an earlier exploratory JSD script called
`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` and would have carried the bug into the ported step.

That call is worth spelling out, because "the tokenizer is slightly wrong" sounds cosmetic
for a divergence metric and is not. Both models are fed the SAME mis-segmented ids, so the
computation does not crash and the numbers look plausible -- they are simply measured on text
in a segmentation neither model was ever trained on. A JSD that says the student moved
toward the teacher, computed on out-of-distribution inputs, is worse than no JSD.
