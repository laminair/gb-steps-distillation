"""The label-masking contract, DERIVED from a tokenizer rather than hardcoded in every config.

WHY THIS IS ONE STEP'S OUTPUT AND NOT A CONFIG FIELD.

Twenty-two gold configs each carry `response_template: "<|im_start|>assistant\\n"`. That value is
not a preference; it is a FACT about the chat template installed on the student, and the configs
restate it by hand. Restating a derived fact is how it goes stale silently: pair Granite 4 with a
different family -- Qwen 3.5, say -- and every one of those configs is wrong, the collator's scan
matches nothing, `CustomDataCollatorForChatML` (utils.py:465-500) leaves every label at
`ignore_index`, and the run trains on NOTHING while producing a loss curve, checkpoints and a
student. There is no post-condition on that path (unlike sft.py:896 and
custom_gold_trainer.py:1785, which raise).

So `distill-tokenizer-align` -- the step that INSTALLS the chat template -- also emits
`masking.json` describing what the template implies for masking, and the configs point at it.
One step owns it; nothing is scattered.

HOW IT IS DERIVED, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS METHOD IS WRONG.

The obvious derivation is to subtract: render `[user]` with and without `add_generation_prompt`
and take the difference. For THIS template that yields `<|im_start|>assistant\\n<think>\\n`
(chat_template.jinja:189-194), which is a plausible-looking answer and a live trap:

  * At TRAINING time the same template emits `<|im_start|>assistant\\n` (line 98) and then
    whatever the assistant content renders to -- `<think>\\n...\\n</think>\\n` for a record that
    carries reasoning, or an injected `<think></think>` for one that does not (lines 90/113/119).
  * So the generation-prompt string occurs in the render of SOME records and not others. A scan
    for it would mask a subset of assistant turns and silently skip the rest -- worse than
    matching nothing, because the loss curve looks fine.

The generation prompt is what you feed at INFERENCE. The response template is what precedes
assistant content at TRAINING time. They are allowed to differ and here they do.

The derivation used instead asks the template itself, in token space:

  1. Render a probe SET whose conversations exercise the template's branches (reasoning content
     present / absent, single and multi turn) under BOTH `enable_thinking` settings, with
     `return_assistant_tokens_mask=True`. The `{% generation %}` markers are ground truth for
     where assistant content starts.
  2. For every assistant turn in every probe, take the ids PRECEDING its first masked token.
  3. The longest common suffix of those id sequences bounds the answer -- common across branches
     is what "always precedes assistant content" means. It is then TRIMMED through the previous
     turn's eos and past any leading whitespace, because otherwise it encodes the probes' own
     conversation shape into the marker, and re-validated against the markers so a trim that
     over-generalised is refused rather than accepted.

Working in token space means the answer cannot be wrong about tokenization. But the collator
encodes the template TEXT standalone (utils.py:349), so the text is decoded back and re-encoded,
and a difference between in-context and standalone ids is a REFUSAL: that difference is the
silent trap in its purest form.

THREE REFUSALS, each naming a real failure:

  * No generation markers (an all-zero mask). Then there is no ground truth here, and GOLD would
    fail anyway at sft.py:909. Says to apply
    patches/granite-chat-template-generation-markers/.
  * A probe set that exercised only ONE branch. Then the common suffix is untested and can be too
    long -- the over-long template is precisely the "matches some records" trap. Refused rather
    than reported, because an over-long template that passes review is the worst outcome here.
  * eos disagreement between config.json and the tokenizer. The collator ends each span at
    `tokenizer.eos_token_id` (utils.py:487) while the model's generation is bounded by
    config.json's. If they differ, one assistant span runs to the end of the sequence and
    swallows the following user turn into the labels.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No `instruction_template`. It is inert -- `instruction_token_ids`
is assigned at utils.py:354 and read nowhere, since the masking loop bounds spans with EOS -- and
a companion check asserts that inertness continues to hold. Emitting
a derived value for a field nothing reads would invite someone to start reading it.
