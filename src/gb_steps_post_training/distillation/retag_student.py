"""
Retag a Granite student onto a teacher's tokenizer, transplanting special-token
embeddings by structural role instead of mean-initializing them.

Ported from an earlier exploratory version of this same surgery. Every path, id, and
mapping here is derived or passed in rather than hardcoded to one sandbox, because
the earlier version held three absolute out-of-tree paths, three hardcoded token
ids, and a preference for a directory nobody outside that sandbox could read.

WHY THE TRANSPLANT EXISTS. A Granite base student and a Granite 4.2 teacher share
100,352 vocab entries and 96 added tokens, but disagree on **17 of those 96 ids**
(measured for both `4.1-3b-base -> 4.2-30b` and `4.0-350m-base -> 4.2-3b`;
identical disagreement sets). Two of the 17 are load-bearing on every single turn:

    id 100256   student <|pad|>          teacher <|im_start|>
    id 100257   student <|end_of_text|>  teacher <|im_end|>   (= EOS)

Training on ChatML data without retagging does not error. It silently treats the
turn markers as ordinary text. Retagging and then *mean-initializing* those rows
is worse in a specific way: under `tie_word_embeddings=True` the embedding matrix
is also the output projection, so a blank EOS row means the model cannot predict
end-of-turn and generates until it hits the length cap. That is exactly what retag
v1 did, and the pre-distillation model emitted gibberish as a result.

So each new ChatML control token is seeded from the original model's embedding for
the token that played the *same structural role* — turn-open from turn-open,
end-of-sequence from end-of-sequence. Only genuinely roleless tokens (a few
`<|unused_*|>`) fall back to the mean of the trained rows.

WHAT ELSE THIS WRITES, AND WHY IT MATTERS. The output directory gets a chat
template installed into it. `gold/` has no config knob for one: `sft.py` reads it
off the tokenizer, and puts `getattr(tokenizer, "chat_template")` into the dataset
cache key (`sft.py:1092`). A student directory with no template means
`apply_chat_template` has nothing to apply, and a template without
`{% generation %}` markers means `assistant_masks` comes back all-zero and
`sft.py:909` raises. Pass `--chat-template
templates/chatml_granite_42_generation.jinja` — the teacher's own upstream
template plus generation markers.
