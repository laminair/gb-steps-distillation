"""Entrypoint: measure divergence and/or entropy of a student against a teacher on a corpus.

Invoked as `python -m gb_steps_post_training.distillation.run_divergence`, the same convention
as build_overlay/retag_student (see steps/distill-tokenizer-align/src/run-align.sh).

REPLACES two earlier exploratory scripts (a JSD script and an entropy script) and their shell
wrappers. The scripts themselves were already argparse-driven and path-clean; the hardcoding
lived in the wrappers, so this port is mostly consolidation plus the tokenizer fixes recorded
in divergence.py.

ONE PROCESS COMPUTES ALL REQUESTED METRICS. The earlier scripts ran jsd and entropy as separate
invocations, which means loading a 30B teacher and re-running every forward pass per metric.
Every metric here is a reduction over the same two logit tensors, so `--metrics jsd,kld,entropy`
costs one pass, not three.
