# Sourced by the GOLD launchers. Defines require_hub_kernels.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. gold.py pre-populates transformers' hub-kernel mapping at
# module scope with local_files_only=True and, on a cache miss, deliberately falls
# through to the ONLINE lazy_load_kernel path -- its own comment says "preflight will
# repopulate the cache". The recorded scripts satisfied that with an unconditional Hub
# download inside every GPU allocation. This repo made the download opt-in
# (GOLD_PREFETCH_KERNELS), which removed the download and, unnoticed, the invariant with
# it. A direct measurement therefore reached the GPU, started vLLM, fanned out to the trainer, and
# only then died ~90s in with a 40-line traceback ending:
#
#   huggingface_hub.errors.OfflineModeIsEnabled: Cannot reach
#   https://huggingface.co/api/models/kernels-community/causal-conv1d/refs
#
# A missing cache entry is a preflight-detectable condition, so it belongs in preflight,
# where it costs seconds and names its own fix. Three-way gate:
#
#   cached                        -> proceed silently
#   missing, GOLD_PREFETCH_KERNELS=1 -> download now (needs egress), then proceed
#   missing, otherwise            -> FATAL, naming prefetch-kernels.sh
#
# WHICH KERNELS ARE REQUIRED. causal-conv1d and mamba-ssm only. These are the Mamba2
# mixer kernels a Granite 4 hybrid model actually needs, and they are exactly the two
# gold.py's preamble preloads. The recorded prefetch also pulled
# kernels-community/vllm-flash-attn3, which this deliberately does NOT require: FA3 is
# reachable only through the vendored GraniteSWAAttention path, which is gated behind
# GOLD_SWA_ARM (see src/gb_steps_post_training/distillation/_swa_arm.py). Requiring it
# would make every run depend on fetching a kernel it never calls.
#
# EXTRA REPOS, per entrypoint. The two Mamba2 kernels above are required by every
# entrypoint in this collection, so they are the defaults. distill-sft-baseline adds a third,
# and the reason is worth stating because it is invisible from the config: sft.py's
# verify_optimization_stack REQUIRES flash_attention_2 on a non-SWA student and aborts every
# rank otherwise -- and transformers 5.x, when the `flash_attn` PACKAGE is absent, serves FA2
# out of the kernels hub instead (modeling_utils.py:1898 -> FLASH_ATTN_KERNEL_FALLBACK
# ['flash_attention_2'] == 'kernels-community/flash-attn2'). This account has no flash_attn
# package, so that fallback is the only FA2 there is here, and a cold cache means the same
# OfflineModeIsEnabled failure a direct measurement paid for -- this time after the corpus is
# tokenized.

  This is not a cache miss, and prefetching will not fix it: the probe failed before it could ask.
  It ran as: $pybin
  Check that this interpreter has the \`kernels\` package. PYBIN defaults to a bare \`python\`,
  which resolves to whatever is first on PATH -- under \`uv run --no-project --with ...\` that is an
  ephemeral environment holding only what was asked for. Pass PYBIN=<the image's python>, or run the
  launcher under the interpreter that has torch.

FATAL: required hub kernels are not in this account's HF cache:
  $out

  The Mamba2 pair is resolved at gold.py import time. With HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 and a cold
  cache that raises OfflineModeIsEnabled *after* the allocation, with the vLLM server and
  the trainer fan-out already up -- which is what a direct measurement spent ~90 GPU-seconds
  proving. kernels-community/flash-attn2, when listed, is transformers' FA2 fallback for
  an environment with no flash_attn package, and sft.py aborts every rank without it.

  Fix once, out of band (idempotent, and the cache is shared across all future runs):

    bsub -G grp_preemptable -q preemptable -gpu "num=1/task:mode=exclusive_process" \\
         -J prefetch-kernels -o data/logs/prefetch-kernels.%J.out \\
         -e data/logs/prefetch-kernels.%J.err \\
         bash prefetch-kernels.sh

  A companion prefetch script (not included in this repo) fetches the same list this check
  requires, including any extra repos passed via KERNEL_REPOS -- for the FA2 fallback:

    KERNEL_REPOS=kernels-community/flash-attn2 bash prefetch-kernels.sh

  Or set GOLD_PREFETCH_KERNELS=1 to download inside this job instead. That works, but
  it spends allocated GPU time on a network fetch and re-does it on every run.
